# Ruby-Text-Adventure
A text RPG made completely in Ruby!

This RPG shows a good functionality of Ruby features:<br />
User input, Loading rb class, Basic i/o for .txt files, Loading certain things from class and Class support.<br />

This is a good skeleton/resource for anyone who want to make their own text adventure game in Ruby.<br />

Q:Why is the text in the graphics.txt broken up?<br />

A:This is so when ruby calls it with the GameScreen class it utilizes less memory. <br />

Q:Why not just load .rb files for graphics.<br />

A:I do both! I wanted to test both features they both work well!
